# Learning AI

This is my personal dive into AI after keeping my head in the sand for far too long. The intent is to grasp the basic concepts and then apply them to some relevant problems.

https://medium.com/bitgrit-data-science-publication/a-roadmap-to-learn-ai-in-2024-cc30c6aa6e16 from [Benedict Neo](https://benedictxneo.medium.com/) is going to be my guide.

## Directory structure

* [./pytorch-intro](./pytorch-intro/) - Intro material on using PyTorch. See the [README](./pytorch-intro/README.md) for the details there.

## PyTorch tutorials on YouTube

## Glossary

* **conda** Package and environment management system
* **Anaconda** Distribution of conda, Anaconda navigator, and 250+ scientific and ML packages
* **PyTorch** A Python machine learning framework, library, etc.
* **venv** The somewhat standard Python tool to manage virtual environments. There are about 3,000 such other tools doing similar things with confusingly similar names. Just pick one so you don't lose your mind. I'll go with this for now.
* **Tensor (PyTorch)** The PyTorch analog to ND arrays. They resemble NumPy arrays in many was and are convertible to/from numpy. For data on the CPU, memory is shared between the Tensor and NumPy array.
* **Dataset (PyTorch)** Data structure storing data samples and corresponding labels
* **DataLoader (PyTorch)** Wraps an iterable around a `Dataset` for easy access
